# Web-based-Crop-Guidance
Collected the soil and weather data set of Kanchipuram district and developed a Machine Learning program to predict the suitable crop based on the geographical location of the farmer.
Pesticide suggestion based on the crop suggested.
Sending weather updates to farmers through SMS using OpenWeatherMap API and fast2sms API.
Displaying real time tweets of agriculture related twitter accounts to ensure the farmer stays up to date with agriculture related news.
The website was built primarily using Flask, but is currently undergoing improvement.
This is a group project.
A proper documentation of the project would be updated later.
